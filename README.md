# Thinkful-Final-Capstone Python

This project is intended (purpose) to gain a broad perspective regarding the US Mass Shooting from 1966 to 2019.

What is a Mass Shooting? 

There are different ways to answer to that question. In order to understand that concept, we might need to clarify the term “mass murder”: has been defined generally as a multiple homicide incident in which four or more victims are murdered, within one event, and in one or more locations in close geographical proximity.
Considering that definition, the Congressional Research Service define a Mass Shooting: “as a multiple homicide incident in which four or more victims are murdered with firearms, within one event, and in one or more locations in close proximity.

Similarly, a “mass public shooting” is defined to mean a multiple homicide incident in which four or more victims are murdered with firearms, within one event, in at least one or more public locations, such as, a workplace, school, restaurant, house of worship, neighborhood, or other public setting.
These incidents are a rooted public problem, and having more information, knowledge, and insights will help prevent future Mass Shootings, save lives, and have better societies. 
Regarding our exercise, we will use the year 1992 as a reference for splitting results in this project (after the Mass Shooting named The Luby's shooting, also known as the Luby's massacre). Please see Objective Hypothesis for more reference.
