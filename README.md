This project is intended (purpose) to gain a broad perspective regarding the US Mass Shooting from 1966 to 2019.

What is a Mass Shooting? 

There are different ways to answer to that question. In order to understand that concept, we might need to clarify the term “mass murder”: has been defined generally as a multiple homicide incident in which four or more victims are murdered, within one event, and in one or more locations in close geographical proximity.
Considering that definition, the Congressional Research Service define a Mass Shooting: “as a multiple homicide incident in which four or more victims are murdered with firearms, within one event, and in one or more locations in close proximity.

Similarly, a “mass public shooting” is defined to mean a multiple homicide incident in which four or more victims are murdered with firearms, within one event, in at least one or more public locations, such as, a workplace, school, restaurant, house of worship, neighborhood, or other public setting.
These incidents are a rooted public problem, and having more information, knowledge, and insights will help prevent future Mass Shootings, save lives, and have better societies. 
Regarding our exercise, we will use the year 1992 as a reference for splitting results in this project (after the Mass Shooting named The Luby's shooting, also known as the Luby's massacre). 

Key questions analyzed:   

What is the trend regarding the occurrence of Mass Shootings in the US?  

Does gender play a role in overall US Mass Shooting?

Does it play a role in the Subject´s Mental Health? 

States where Mass Shootings occur: Does it matter? 

Statistical interpretation of various trends across the number of people killed or injured per year.

Objective Hypothesis

I want to analyze if the number of US Mass Shootings has decreased over time with less casualties (Injured + Fatalities). 
I will use a z-test to evaluate if there is a statistically significant difference in proportion of US Mass Shootings with less casualties.
The Luby´s Mass Shooting occurred in October 1991; I will test all US Mass Shootings from 1966-1991 against US Mass Shootings from 1992-2019. 

1. Hypothesis testing: z-test

In this scenario, I want to examine whether there is a significant difference in the proportion of US Mass Shootings from before and after 1992.

Ho: p1 - p2 = 0
Ha: p1 - p2 ≠ 0

2. Our Hypothesis: 

Does Mental Health play a role in the occurrence of Mass Shootings? 

Ho: p1 - p2 = 0 There is no difference between the Mental Health of Male and Mental Health of female.
Ha: p1 - p2 ≠ 0 There is difference between the Mental Health of Male and Mental Health of female.
